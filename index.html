<h1>About Me</h1>
<pre>
    Here's a little about me:
    I'm 18 years old, attending Iowa State University as a freshman Cyber Security Engineering major.
    I have a relevant certification, the <a href="CompTIA A+ Certification.pdf">CompTIA A+</a>, and I did a summer internship at <a href="https://www.anetd.com">Advanced Network Devices</a>.
    This is the <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> if that's what you're looking for.

    Here's a <b>reflection</b> on how my concept of programming has changed since my taking COMS 2270:
    Before COMS 2270, Programming was a means to an end.
    Every programming assignment or adventure I had ever completed was done from start to finish,
    with no real planning or structure, without many hiccups. Now, with bigger projects,
    comes more debugging, more dead ends, and more frustration. I have a newfound appreciation
    for planning, drafting and debugging.
